# Facets

Faceting is a method of high-performance filtering that uses multiple dimensions of attribute values as search criteria. Faceted search is similar, but considerably “smarter” than the standard [layered navigation](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/catalog/navigation/navigation-layered.html). The list of available filters is determined by the [filterable attributes](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/catalog/navigation/navigation-layered.html#filterable-attributes) of products returned in the search results.

## Faceting requirements

The category and product attribute requirements for faceting are similar to the filterable attributes used for layered navigation. The storefront properties of each attribute must be set to `filterable (with results)`.

Live Search supports up to:

* 100 attributes configured as facets
* 50 sortable attributes
* 200 filterable attributes
* 200 searchable attributes

| Setting | Description |
|--- |--- |
| [Category display settings](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/categories/create/categories-display-settings.html) | Anchor - `Yes` |
| [Attribute properties](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/product-attributes/create/attribute-product-create.html) | [Catalog Input type](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/product-attributes/attributes-input-types.html) - `Yes/No`, `Dropdown`, `Multiple Select`, `Price` |
| Attribute storefront properties | Use in Search Results Layered Navigation - `Yes` |

## Default attribute values

The following product attributes have [storefront properties](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/docs/commerce-admin/catalog/product-attributes/product-attributes.html) that are used by [!DNL Live Search] and enabled by default.
